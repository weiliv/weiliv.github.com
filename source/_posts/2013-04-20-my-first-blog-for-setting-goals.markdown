I still remember when maintaining MSN space the first year I entered college. Then now I come back! Coz during the busy developping work, I rarely have time to write down some of the tips I need to achive. And what most of all, I should refect on my life regularly and regularly which is the exactly thing I seldom do.

As the title says, here some of goals are listed that I should cost my passion to acheive, at least try my best before 2014.1.1. Though today is Apr 20th, 2013, better later than never to set goals!  

### Goals on Work

Though I've acted as an IOS developper for more than a half year, I'm still a newbie definitly. And new techs come out year by year, learning should never stop.

* Learn more about ARC principle of the IOS, and try to migrate our project to ARC. ARC is a free of worry  achitecture that can save us a lot of time debugging and optimizing the memory issures which have anoyed us  since the last year when we start CYZS project. So we can "release" our dev resource on memory leaking or crashing, then focus on the logical optimization.
*  When a new ios project kicks off, automating UI test should join in. 
*  Try to participate on the server devlepment, learn relative knowlege from Lucky and Tom.
*  Be active on building of the engineers' culture in our company, such as orgnizing some coding games and attending some tech conferences or forums as Karry pointed out.

### Goals on Life

* Keeping fit
   * Running, from now on maybe 150km? Recheck with Nike+. 
   * Basketball, once for 2 weeks.
* Guita, practice and practice.
* Real estate, find one.
* The most important one, you know that!

Hope all the goals will be defeated at the end of 2013.
